//===============================
// Create User
//===============================

/* INFO: we will consider our project name is `laracasts` and we will create user with name `laracasts` */

/* Isolated the site within a directory owned by a dedicated user, laracasts. and nginx along with php-fpm can access the files in this 
   directory as they need */
   
/* INFO: create user for each site allow this user to pull from the git repo and restrict its access to only the site it owns. */


/* add user */
> sudo adduser laracasts

/* move the application files from the defaut var/www to the laracasrs user's home directory */
> sudo mv /var/www/laracasts /home/laracasts/www

/* INFO: now if we check the home direcory we will find two users one for ubuntu user and one for laracasts user */


/* move from ubuntu user to laracasts user */
> sudo su laracasts

/* check the laracast direcory we will find www directory still owned by www-data user, 
   we need to change the ownership to the laracasts user and group,
   and to do that we need to exist our laracasts session and go back to ubunutu  */

/* INFO: after list, we see the permissions on each of the home directories here indicate that the owner can read, write and execute.
	 members for the group can read and execute only. and all other users can not do anything inside these directories */

/* Since all the site files now belongs to the laracasts user group, www-data won't be able to access them, and to fix that we are going to add
   www-data user to the laracasts group, this will allow it to read files but won't write.
   and then we are going to change the user used by phpfpm to laracasts instead of www-data, so it can read and write files in this directory */

> sudo usermod -a -G laracasts www-data

/* Then let's open the php-fpm pool configurations */
> sudo nano /etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

/* UPDATE FILE: we will first change the name of the pool from www to laracasts, we will create separate pools for all sites on the server */
> www -> laracasts
/* UPDATE FILE: then we will find an attribute called user and change it to laracasts. */
> www-data -> laracasts
/* UPDATE FILE: then we find an attribute name owner, change it to laracasts. and same for the group as well */
> www-data -> laracasts
/* INFO: the first user and group attribute decide which user php-fpm will use when reading and writing the application files, 
	 the listen owner and listen group attributes decide the owners of the socket file php-fpm creats as a communication channel between
	 it and nginx */

/* INFO: Since the owner and group are set to laracasts, phpfpm will be able to read and write on this files. 
	 and since the www-data user used by nginx now belongs to the laracasts group it will also able to read and write on this file. */

/* INFO: the default permissions on that socket file is 660 which means that owners can read and write, the user and the group member as well */

/* So now let's go edit the nginx configuration file */
> sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-availabe/laracats
/* UPDATE FILE: change root to /home/laracasts/www/public */
> /var/www/laracasts/public -> /home/laracasts/www/public



/* restart nginx and fpm & clear cache if required */
> sudo service nginx reload
> sudo service php8.1-fpm restart

/* to allow the laracasts user to pull from the github repo, and to do that we are going to move the keys we previously generated for
   the ubuntu user to the laracasts user. that way laracasts can access the github repo */
